I am an Industrial Engineer (IE) who sees my profession as fundamentally about improving lives, industries, and communities. Industrial Engineers seek to improve quality, resiliency and efficiency of opperations and systems, while reducing costs and waste.

As a Professor of Operations and Industrial Engineering at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute] (https://www.wpi.edu/), I have three main roles: research, teaching, and service.

​My research focuses on applying operations research methods to critical social issues. I use optimization, simulation, and data analytics to address challenges in humanitarian logistics, illicit network detection, and healthcare operations. My research is supported by several federal awards, and I served as a Fulbright Scholar in Ukraine in 2021/22.

My teaching spans from undergraduate to PhD levels, with courses in stochastic processes, simulation, and research methods. I was honored to receive the Romeo L. Moruzzi Young Faculty Award for innovative teaching and the IISE Simulation Teaching Award.

My service activities include leadership roles within [INFORMS] (https://www.informs.org/), contributions on campus, and appointments to advisory committees addressing human trafficking for both the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
